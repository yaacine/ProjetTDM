    <string name="description_test">Certainly having multiple Scrol
        lViews on a screen is not an issue; the parent layout simply needs to be arranged so they al
        l have room on the screen. As for one ScrollView inside another, that difficult. Instead, the Android compatibility lib
        rary has NestedScrol
        lView. There are lots of tutorials on the web for how to use NestedScrollView for that application. â€“ Ted Hopp Dec </string>
